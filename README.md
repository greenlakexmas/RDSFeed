RDSFeed
=======

RDSFeed is an application for constructing text strings from multiple inforation sources for use over RDS. Actually,
"RDS" (which standard for Radio Data System) is a misnomer here -- I use this application for sending data over
RDS. However, it can just as easily work for other systems that can accept text, such as scrolling LED readers.
